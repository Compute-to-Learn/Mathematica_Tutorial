# Mathematica Tutorial
This repo contains the Mathematica Tutorial that we have peer leaders (undergraduate students who took the course the previous semester) present during the first three weeks to the students as an introduction to programming in Mathematica and examples of tools commonly used within Wolfram demonstrations. At the beginning of the semester, the students receive the blank tutorial called "Mathematica_Tutorial.nb" and complete the examples by following the peer leaders and receiving assistance from peer leaders or graduate student instructors when necessary. Once the tutorial has been completed, we give the students the "Mathematica_Tutorial-completed.nb" file, which has all the examples completed along with the answers to the challenges. The "Mathematica_Tutorial-completed&annotated.pdf" file is the file the peer leaders use when presenting the tutorial, as it includes instructions on how to present certain topics and examples.

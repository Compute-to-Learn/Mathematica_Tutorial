# Mathematica Tutorial
This repo contains the Mathematica Tutorial that we have peer leaders (undergraduate students who took the course the previous semester) present during the first three weeks to the students as an introduction to programming in Mathematica and examples of tools commonly used within Wolfram demonstrations.

More information about Compute-to-Learn can be found at our website: http://umich.edu/~pchem/about.html.
